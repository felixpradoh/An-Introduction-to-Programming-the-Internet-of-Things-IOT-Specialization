# Peer-graded Assignment: Peer Assignment: EEPROM Sketch

**Instructions**

Write about the design of a system that you might build for your home which uses an Arduino with a wifi shield. The system must use the wifi connection for a useful purpose in the system. The Arduino should be wired to sensors and/or actuators which help it to perform some useful task in your home. Be sure to clearly describe the need for the wifi connection in your system.

**Review criteria**

For full credit, clearly describe a system that uses sensors/actuators and has a real requirement for WiFi.

See the details on the Course Overview page regarding purchasing the hardware and/or using a web-based simulator.

SmartCamera is a good example which uses as an Arduino with a Wi-Fi shield. For example, a smart camera detects from its inside that there is no butter, so it orders butter for you through different products companies. The main sensor that will be wired to the Arduino is a camera sensor. The Wi-Fi connection will be needed to provide the products that are sold online and that will be sent directly to home. It is also needed to do the online payment.

BabyMotion detector: is a good example where the Arduino with a Wi-Fi Shield could be used. A camera detects your baby's motion, audio with a mic, or attendance. The images can be sent over the internet and received on your laptop, mobile phone, or tablet. The Wi-Fi module connection will be needed to provide the communication.

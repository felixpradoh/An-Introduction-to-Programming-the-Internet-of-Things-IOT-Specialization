# Peer-graded Assignment: Module 2 Peer Assignment

Boot the Raspberry Pi and install the “scrot” program to take screen shots. You can install it by typing “sudo apt-get install scrot” in a terminal window. Use the scrot program to take a screenshot of your Raspberry Pi.

You will need to submit the screenshot as evidence that you completed the task, but you should submit the screenshot using your Raspberry Pi. This means that you will need to use the WiFi adapter to connect the Raspberry Pi to the Internet via a router that is configured for DHCP. This is a straightforward task but you will need to look up the details on your own. Once you have connected your Raspberry Pi to the Internet, use a web browser to submit the screenshot. I recommend using Epiphany as the browser since it is packaged with the Raspian/NOOBS installation.

### Identify two embedded systems that are sold on the market today and analyze their interfaces.
    1. Smart Scale: It is a basic white plate with certain sensors (pressure, electrical current, ...)
    2. Smart Watch: A digital watch with embedded sensors and microcontrollers (heart rate, GPS, compass,...)

### Describe all inputs to each system and outputs from each system.

    1. Smart Scale: The inputs are the weight of your body and the "electrolytes" of your body. The outputs are your calculated health parameters with your inputs (Corporal mass index, body fat %, water level,  base metabolism, visceral fats, bone mass )
    2. Smart Watch: In this case, the main input is the heart rate, but some others like vibrations or certain movements are used as inputs. It gives you a lot of outputs related to your ordinary activities, quality of sleep, and some other things from external outputs (weather, latitude ...)

### Classify the inputs and outputs based on their mode of interaction: 
    -Visual - describing data carried by visible light
    -Audio - describing data carried by sound
    -Tactile - describing data carried by touch 
    -Electronic - describing data encoded in electrical signals

    The inputs for these devices are:
        - Visible: in the case of the smart watch (visible because used green light to detect blood)
        - Tactile and electronic: in the case of the smart scale to measure your weight, and your fat composition.
        - The outputs are merely visual throught a screen, tactile if contains some alarm vibrations and audio in so- me cases.

#### Research two microcontrollers and provide information about them from their datasheets. There are several microcontroller manufacturers that you can investigate including Atmel, Microchip, Freescale, TI, etc. For each microcontroller, report the following information. (Be sure to include a link to an online reference where you found this information.)  
    - Clock frequency
    - Bitwidth of the datapath
    - Size of Flash memory
    - Number of pins
    - Does the microcontroller contain an Analog-to-Digital Converter? If so, how many bits of precision does it have?

    1. Arduino Uno Rev3 (ATmega328P) https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATmega48A-PA-88A-PA-168A-PA-328-P-DS-DS40002061A.pdf

    Clock frequency: 16 MHz
    Bitwidth of the datapath: 8-bit
    Size of Flash memory: 32 KB
    Number of pins: 28-32, depending on the package.
    Does the microcontroller contain an Analog-to-Digital Converter? If so, how many bits of precision does it have?  Yes it does, with a 10-bit resolution

    2. RaspberryPi (RP2040) https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf
    Clock frequency:   133MHz  
    Bitwidth of the datapath: 32-bit
    Size of Flash memory: 16 MB
    Number of pins: 56
    Does the microcontroller contain an Analog-to-Digital Converter? If so, how many bits of precision does it have? Yes, it does. A 12-bit x 4 channels.

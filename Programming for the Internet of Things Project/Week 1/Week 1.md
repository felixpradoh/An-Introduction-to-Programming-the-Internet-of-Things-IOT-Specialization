# Peer-graded Assignment: Assignment 1: Requirements Specification Document

*Write a requirement specification document describing your Capstone project. The document should be relatively short -- under two pages. The document should describe the behavior from a user’s perspective as well as a designer’s perspective.*

*From the user’s perspective, the document should fully describe how the system is used. Depending on your system, a picture of the user interface might be helpful here. From the designer’s perspective, the behavior of the system should be completely specified, in all cases, so that a designer has a complete description to work from. The requirements specification should also include all relevant constraints, including cost, design/implementation time, performance, etc.*
